# Built_In_Delegates

Func, Action and Predicate are define in C# 3.0 and these are generic inbuilt delegates.

Func Delegate
*Func is generic delegate present in System namespace. 
*It takes one or more input parameters and returns one out parameter. 
*The last parameter is considered as a return value.
*Func delegate type can include 0 to 16 input parameters of different types. 
*It must have one return type. So return type is mandatory but input parameter is not.

Action Delegate
*Action is a generic delegate present in System namespace. 
*It takes one or more input parameters and returns nothing.
*So it does not return any value.

Predicate Delegate
*Predicate delegate is also inbuilt generic delegate and is present in System namespace.
*It is used to verify certain criteria of method and returns output as Boolean, either True or False.
*Predicate can be used with method, anonymous and lambda expression.
